# Title: Prophet Challenge

# Description: Making Predictions with Time Series Data 
This week's challenge consisted of analyzing financial and user data to enhance company growth and was completed in Colab using concepts such as:

1. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Making specific, actionable predictions based on data
2. **Plotting Time Series Data**
   - Generating data visualizations for easier reading and analysis
3. **Analyzing Results**
    - Understanding and interpreting time series data, and incorporating an understanding of relationships between data points

# Background: 

With over 200 million users, [Mercado Libre](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/about-us/) is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. As a growth analyst for the company,  the challenge is to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock. This is completed as follows:

**Step 1:** Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

 - *Google search traffic increased by over 8% during the month that MercadoLibre released its financial results*

**Step 2:** Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

 - *Google search traffic increases as the day goes on from 10 a.m., decreases as the week goes on, and is at its highest during the colder months*

**Step 3:** Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

 - *Data collected shows a predictable relationship between lagged search traffic and stock volatility*
   
**Step 4:** Create a time series model with Prophet
